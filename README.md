Not just another Java project :D

For compile and run I used terminal so if you want to use terminal here are the commands:

-> Open terminal
-> javac App/* Utilities/* (for compile)
-> java App/App  (for run)

A brief descrpition of what you see:

Through class Plane I create a Plane object. Then with the random function I create many diffrenent components of the plane. You can see in my code the abstract classes and the inheritances.
I also create 3 employees each one specializes at a Component (Security Employee , Maintenace Employee and Cleaning Employee). Then one by one go through all the Plane's Components and do their work in order to make sure that the plane is ready to take off. After all of them finish their work the program ends.
